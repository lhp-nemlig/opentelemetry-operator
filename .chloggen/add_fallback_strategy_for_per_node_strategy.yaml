  If using per-node allocation strategy, targets that are not attached to a node will not
  be allocated. As the per-node strategy is required when running as a daemonset, it is 
  not possible to assign some targets under a daemonset deployment.
  Feature flag operator.targetallocator.fallbackstrategy has been added and results in consistent-hashing
  being used as the fallback allocation strategy for "per-node" only at this time.
